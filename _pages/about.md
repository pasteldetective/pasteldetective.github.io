I am a master's student in Data Science at CUNY School of Professional Studies with hands-on experience in data visualization, survey research, and inclusive data-driven analysis. I currently work as a part-time Tableau Dashboard Developer at CUNY’s Office of Applied Research, Evaluation and Data Analytics (OAREDA), where I design interactive dashboards to support data-informed decision-making.

At the Trustworthy, Intelligent, and Explainable Robotics (TIER) Lab at Hunter College under Dr. Raj Korpan, I apply data science methodologies to conduct survey research aimed at amplifying the perspectives of marginalized communities in robotics and AI studies. My research interests include inclusive user studies design, human-robot interaction, and the intersection of public policy and data governance.

I hold a Bachelor’s in Computer Science from Hunter College. Previously, I was involved in fellowships at COOP Careers and BASTA, where I focused on data analytics and career readiness in tech.
