(This project was done as part of my Practical Web Development class)

This project is intended to gain experience in **React application development** through:

- Learning about **client-side routing**
- Adding **client-side routing** to React applications using **React Router**
- Setting up **React Router** to enable common browser behavior
- Utilizing built-in **React Router components** (Route, Router, Link, and Redirect)
- Working with common **React features** such as **components**, **state**, **props**, **event handlers**, etc.
