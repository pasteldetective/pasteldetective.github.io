(This project was done as part of my Practical Web Development class)

This project is intended to build a **Campus Management System** using the full-stack web technologies of **PostgreSQL**, **Express**, **React**, and **Node.js** (PERN technology stack).

## Project Goals:

- Building a **RESTful full-stack web application** to manage students and campuses using **Node**, **Express**, **React**, **Redux**, **PostgreSQL**, and **Sequelize** (an ORM).
  
- Implementing the **CRUD** operations of a database: **Create**, **Read**, **Update**, and **Delete**.
  
- Writing **models**, querying a database with **Object-Relational Mapping (ORM)**, designing routes/endpoints, and handler functions to process user requests and generate responses.
  
- Developing **React components**, managing the application state with **React Redux**, and much more.
  
- Creating two individual repositories for **client-side (front-end)** and **server-side (back-end)** applications (i.e., a separate client and a separate server), for separation of concerns and modularity.
