## Introduction
Detained with violent force and displaced. Sounds familiar? In the 19th century, sinophobia intensified in the United States. Before, Chinese Americans took on low waged jobs that white settlers shied away from. However, when jobs became scarce, the same settlers began viewing them as direct competition. [^1] What followed shortly in response was the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, the first and only major U.S. federal law to explicitly ban immigration for a specific race or nationality. [^2] Less talked about is the aftermath, the brutal legacy it left behind and the similarities which prevail in today’s political landscape. 

## Tacoma Method
While these settlers viewed Chinese-American as lesser people, the Chinese Exclusion Act codified their opinions of them. Now since the Chinese can't legally immigrate here, there must be something wrong with them. In Tacoma, Washington 1885, one can say that is the case. Led by their mayor Jacob Weisbach, he hosted countless meetings to discuss and "consider the Chinese question:" expelling the Chinese community there. [^3]  Weisbach and countless other white ‘Tacomans’ (Tacoma residents) did not view the Chinese residents as equals. In one of Weisbach’s closing speeches addressing this question, he states: “If the [White] people are in earnest, if they are Free Americans in fact they will not yield up their homes and business to the filthy [Chinese] horde.” [^4] Ultimately, this "Anti-Chinese Congress," decided that, on November 1st, they’d take up action. [^5]

Although enacted 2 days after their initial date, on November 3rd a mob of nearly 500 white citizens armed with pistols and clubs gathered with malicious intent. [^6]
