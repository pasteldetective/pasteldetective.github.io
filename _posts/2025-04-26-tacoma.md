## Introduction
Detained with violent force and displaced. Sounds familiar? In the 19th century, sinophobia intensified in the United States. Before, Chinese Americans took on low waged jobs that white settlers shied away from. However, when jobs became scarce, the same settlers began viewing them as direct competition. [^1] What followed shortly in response was the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, the first and only major U.S. federal law to explicitly ban immigration for a specific race or nationality. [^2] Less talked about is the aftermath, the brutal legacy it left behind and the similarities which prevail in todayâ€™s political landscape.
